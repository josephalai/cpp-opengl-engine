     *        vectors and matrices in Camera, which ultimately, later is retrieved by:
     *        getViewMatrix(), loaded into a shader, and rendered on the screen.
     *
     *        When the player modifies the vectors (transformations), by the keyboad and mouse,
     *        the camera actually modifies itself based on those movements. Again, this is all
     *        just manipulation of vectors. Nothing is being rendered yet.
