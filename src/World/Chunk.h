     *  When texturing a mesh, you need a way to tell to OpenGL which part of the image has to be used for each triangle. This is done with UV coordinates.
     *  Each vertex can have, on top of its position, a couple of floats, U and V. These coordinates are used to access the texture, in the following way :

     *   Chunks are the method used by the world generator to divide maps into manageable pieces.
